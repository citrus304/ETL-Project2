                    <p class='text'>"Alaska is the Top state with the largest number of acres burnt". The fires are part of a summer of extremes in Alaska – record heat, lightning strikes in unlikely places, extraordinary meltdown of glaciers and widespread die-offs of animals, including whales, seals, birds and masses of pre-spawned salmon killed in waters with temperatures measured as high as 80 degrees F (26.7 C).</p>
                    <p class='text'>"Arizona witnessed the largest number of acres burnt in June 2011".June is frequently a dry month statewide, and this year was no exception. Significant precipitation has not
                      fallen in Arizona since mid-May. This dryness has worsened the drought impacts of the dry winter and spring.
                      Wells are drying up across the northern counties. Strong winds and high temperatures have dried out the soil
                      and vegetation. Over the past month, the percentage of the state in each drought category has increased,
                      and only a narrow area along the lower Colorado River is currently without drought.</p>
                      <p class='text'>"The weeks in June are the deadliest in total number of acres burnt" These weeks mark the end of summer but due to global warming, there is an increasing trend of warm climate and extended heat spells, resulting in a trend of deadly wildfires</p>
